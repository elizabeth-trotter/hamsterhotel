**Name:** Elizabeth Trotter

**Project Note:** I was given a mockup and tasked with making it into a static website using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `Bootstrap`. I was also required to ensure the website was `responsive` for all screen sizes. Although it was a bit of a learning curve working with responsiveness for the first time, I enjoyed the challenge. 

*Also, I am a fellow pet enthusiast :feet: so this was a super fun and cute project to work on!*
