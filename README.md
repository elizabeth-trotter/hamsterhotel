# Hamster Hotel :hamster: :hotel: :white_flower:

**Name:** Elizabeth Trotter

**Project Description:** I was given a mockup and tasked with making it into a fully functioning website using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `Bootstrap`. Although it was a bit of a learning curve for me, I enjoyed the challenge. Also, I am a fellow pet enthusiast :feet: so this was a super fun and cute project to work on!
